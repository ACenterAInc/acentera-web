    <h2>Intro to ACenterA Community Portal</h2>

 	Unlike a traditional Play Web Application, the controllers only responds to JSON Requests, making it great to build a RestFull API at the same time as building your Web Application.
        <br/>
        The Web UI is built using the ".handlebars" templates, thanks to the <pre>com.ketalo.play.plugins - play-emberjs</pre>
