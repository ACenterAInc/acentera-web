    <h2>Intro to ACenterA Community Portal</h2>
    
    <p>
        ACenterA Web Portal is an <a href="http://www.acentera.com/">Enterprise Ready Cloud Management Portal</a>, it is aiming to manage multi-cloud providers. We hope that the community will provide pull requests, in order to improve this framework and make everyone benefits from it. <br/> 
        <br/>
 	Unlike a traditional Play Web Application, the controllers only responds to JSON Requests, making it great to build a RestFull API at the same time as building your Web Application.
        <br/>
        If you prefer to only use the Portal without the needs to manage it, you may visit our <a href="http://www.acentera.com">ACenterA Cloud Databases</a>, where you can see / use the full features without any fees.
